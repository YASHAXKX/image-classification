For an image classification project using SVM with an RBF kernel, heuristic fine-tuning is applied to optimize hyperparameters like C and gamma, improving model performance. The data processing involves Haar Cascade for object detection, enhancing relevant feature extraction, and wavelet transforms to capture both spatial and frequency information, boosting accuracy by focusing on multi-resolution analysis. This combination efficiently captures essential features for classification. The SVM, with its kernel trick, maps data to higher dimensions, while heuristic fine-tuning balances underfitting and overfitting. Overall, integrating these methods enhances the modelâ€™s ability to classify complex images accurately and efficiently.



This is a face recognition project 

To run this follow these steps:

Step1:Clone this repo/unzip the file

Step2: Install requirements.txt by using "pip/pip3 install -r requirements.txt"

Step3: The final prototype is app4.py, so use that instead of other python scripts

Step4: Use streamlit to run the app5.py project by entering "strealit run app5.py" in the terminal

Step5: Select one from uploading the photo or Webcam option.


Use good quality images or camera for correct result

Go to line 214 of app5.py file to change the interval of face recognition in webcam
